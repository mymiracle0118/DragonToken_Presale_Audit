/*
   Launch instructions:
Set values in the constructor, and constant values at the start of the contract.
Deploy contract with solidity version: 0.8.24, EVM version: Paris, and runs optimized: 200.
Verify contract.
Add all dragon tokens as LP using the functions in the contract during Phase 0, so all 8 tokens have starter LP DRAGON/CT, then run setPairs() to save the pairs.
All DRAGON tokens are now in LP, there are no initial team tokens or other initial distributions.
Initialize phases startTime for some future time, set whale limits per phase, and finally ***lock phases***.
Set allowlists that we have so far for each phase.
Set socials on block explorer and dexscreener.
Transfer contract ownership to multisig, requiring multiple signatures per transaction, where each signer is a unique person and wallet and device.
Release medium article showing tokenomics, audit report, DEXs, LP burnt, contract address, farm collection address, treasury address, and multisig signer addresses.
IDO launch after marketing and bonus allowlist gathered and input.
Later, transfer contract ownership to a community run and owned DAO, possibly with 48hr timelocks in effect, which might use the OpenZeppelin Defender voting system.
Bug bounty could be good to set up on https://www.sherlock.xyz/ or https://code4rena.com/ or similar.
Optional future upgrade of processFees() to external contract that might implement slippage protections, V4 LP, or other features.
